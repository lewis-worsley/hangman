# Hangman
Hangman is an old school, popular game which is suitable for all ages. The point of the game is to test the player's vocabulary by guessing one letter at a time to solve the word puzzle.

For the player to win the game they must guess each world correctly within a certain amount of lives.

## How to play
<hr>

The aim of the game is for the player to correctly guess the hidden word that is randomly chosen by the computer. If all the letters in the word have been guessed correctly - within the given amount of lives (which is 6) - then the player has the game.

To play the user must type a single letter into the terminal. However, if the player was to submit an incorrect command, the terminal will prompt the player to pick another letter, whilst explaining why their last command didn't work.

If all letter have been guessed correctly or their lives fall to zero the game is over.

The hidden word will look like this (length will vary): _ _ _ _ _ _

As the player guesses letter, it will begin to look similar to this example: _ R _ V E_
